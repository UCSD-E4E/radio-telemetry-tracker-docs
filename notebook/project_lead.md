# RTT Project Lead Overview
This page is meant to give additional information for project leads, especially as you get started in the role. Team members are welcome to read it, particularly if interested in taking on greater responsibilities within the team.

### Formal Responsibilities:
- Attend weekly meetings with the E4E directors. Give slide updates every other week on the team's progress, and be prepared for a quick verbal update on weeks RTT does not present.
- Organize weekly team meetings during which team members give updates, ask questions, and receive new tasks. Delegate tasks to the team based on the project's current needs and each student's skill set.
- Present for RTT during quarterly information sessions. This will involve having a quick "elevator pitch" ready to go to explain and advertise RTT, as well as being able to answer questions for prospective members. You should come prepared knowing what skills the project currently needs most.
- Onboard new students. This is related to the information session and involves reviewing applications and resumes; scheduling, preparing for, and hosting interviews for prospective members; and completing the "team lead" responsibilities in Onboarding for new members.
- Develop a working understanding of the project as a whole, including outside of the discipline(s) with which you are most comfortable. You should have some grasp of the project's quarterly goals, the work involved to achieve those goals, and what each team member can contribute. This ranges from the hardware we assemble to the software we write.

### Other Responsibilities:
- Be available to support team members in their tasks, including providing clear instructions for tasks and advice on how to get started.
- Keep RTT's website presence up-to-date. This includes updating available roles and desired skills for each quarter's new applicants. It's meant to include blog posts I think, but our page has been languishing a bit in that departmentâ€¦
- Keep this handbook up to date so it is most useful to yourself, your team, and future team members and leads.

### Resources:
- Interview templates with sample questions are available on the NAS under rct > From Google Drive > Programmatics > Interview Questions. These are meant to be guides to help you in interviewing candidates, not a strict TODO list of questions you must ask.
- Previous quarters' weekly presentation and info session slides can be found in the NAS under programmatics, with a subfolder for each quarter's presentation files. These can be copied for their format, but content should be updated for each new presentation.

### Tips/Other:
- You are a student too. If you do not know something and cannot find the answer yourself, ask for help, whether from a teammate who might know, from other project leads, or from our staff engineer.
- Developing an understanding of different relevant disciplines is difficult, particularly when you likely haven't formally studied all of them. There will be a learning curve to gather this understanding of the whole project. Bringing on a colead (if you do not already have one) who has complementary skills to yours can be a big help.
- Remember that you have authority as your project's lead. Establish deadlines and ensure members of your team follow E4E policies so that your project stays on track.
- Maintain some flexibility and understanding, both for yourself and your team. E4E is not the only commitment students will have.
