# Sealab
Sealab is E4E's lab. This is CSE 2127. If you don't know where this is, go up the stairs in the CSE building to the second floor, turn right, and walk past the bathrooms; Sealab will be on your right. A door code is needed to access Sealab. If you need access, ask our staff engineer for the current quarter's door code. DO NOT share the door code.

### Lab rules:
- Wear close-toed shoes.
- We say no food or drink, but if you fudge this one just make sure food and drink are *never* placed near electronics or machinery. Place them on the ground, on a chair, or on an otherwise cleared desk.
- Clean up after yourself and leave the lab at least as clean as you found it. Store items in a secure and organized manner, throw away any trash, and for goodness' sake please don't leave abandoned drink containers (this is a problem).
- Do not use equipment which you have not been trained to use. If your tasks require the use of equipment for which you are not trained, ask for training.
