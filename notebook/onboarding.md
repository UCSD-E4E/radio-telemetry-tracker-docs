Welcome to E4E's Radio Telemetry team! Here are some TODO items to get started:

- Join Slack and our #rct_ops channel

### From the team lead:
- Invitation to team meetings (these should also be on the E4E calendar)
- NAS access (Firstname Lastname in description, access to rct files, set expected expiration)
- Invitation to Trello board
- Review of completed git/GitHub training, including explanation of what is correct for any missed questions
- Addition to GitHub team (AFTER training is completed)
- Next steps or an introductory task assignment
