# Radio Telemetry Tracker Notebook

This is a "notebook-style" reference for Radio Telemetry Tracker team members. All contents in this `notebook` directory are meant to clarify what we do, establish what our team expectations are, and share answers to common questions team members may have. 

### What is Radio Telemetry Tracker? 
Radio Telemetry Tracker (RTT) was established back in 2012 as an effort to track animals using radio telemetry. Traditional on-foot methods require researchers to trek through difficult terrain with unwieldy antennae, so a new drone-based system was developed to fly over an area in which animals equipped with transmitters can be found. An omni-directional antenna pointing downward beneath the drone picks up pings from the transmitters and sends that data back to a machine running our ground control station (GCS).

Recently, the project has been working on a new, tower-based system, in which several towers would be set up around a predetermined area and collect pings regularly throughout a deployment. Both the drone and tower systems are currently in development.

A system mounted on a quadruped robot was briefly in development but is currently on ice.

This project was previously known as "Radio Collar Tracker", and legacy code and documentation still refers to it as such. If you see "radio collar" or "RCT", it still refers to our team's work the same as if it said "RTT".
