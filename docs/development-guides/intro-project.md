# Introduction Project - Simple Web GIS Project

## Introduction

The Radio Telemetry Traker project is a collaboration with the San Diego Zoo's Insitute for Conservation Research, with the overall goal of developing an efficient system for tracking animals with radio transmitters. One key part of the project is the ground control system (GCS). The GCS allows remote control of the field devices, and more importantly, visualizes the estimated location of the animals and the devices. This will be the focus of the intro project.

## Intro Project

Create a simple web geographic information system (GIS) application.

### Requirements

Requirements marked as MAY are ideas for the application as **you should not spend more that 3 hours on this project.**

- The application MUST be written in Python
- The application MUST use [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) as the web framework
- The application SHOULD use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management
- The application SHOULD use a GIS toolkit such as [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) or [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)
- The application MAY be containerized using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- The application MAY have the ability to load in a GeoTIFF image as basemap
- The application MAY have the ability to load webmap tiles as a basemap
- The application MAY have the ability to load in and display content from a shapefile
- The application MAY have the ability to load in and display content from a GeoJSON file
- The application MAY display landmarks on a map
- The application MAY use other open source libraries and tools

### Deliverables

- A link to a public GitHub repository (may be deleted after the interview/decision)
