# Overview
In order to maximize the performance of the system, it is imperative that the
antenna used match the transmitter frequencies.

In the RCT system, we are using a dipole antenna for the following reasons:
- It is simple to design and build.
- It is lightweight.
- It has a very omnidirectional radiation pattern.
- It has a decently wide bandwidth with respect to the current applications.

# Design
There are several parameters that describe the antenna:
- `L`: overall length of the antenna
- `l`: length of the individual element
- `d`: element diameter
